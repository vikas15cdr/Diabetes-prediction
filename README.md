# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Model

A machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health data. This model helps identify potential risk using classification techniques and performance evaluation metrics.

## âœ¨ Features
- Trained on patient data to classify diabetic vs non-diabetic outcomes
- Implements algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and others
- Evaluates predictions using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**
- Provides insights into health risk factors through exploratory analysis

## ðŸš€ Technologies
- Python, Pandas, scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning (Supervised Learning)
